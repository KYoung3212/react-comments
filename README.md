# `react-comments`

My implementation of the tutorial found at https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

To explore the code, start at `src/client/app/index.jsx` and work your way from there.

##Directions

0. If you don't already have Node.js installed, [get it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

1. Clone or fork the repository.

2. In Node, run `npm init` on the root `react-hello-world` directory. Follow the instructions in the prompt.

3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

4. Run `npm run build` to make webpack compile the `bundle.js` assets.

5. Open `src/client/index.html` in a web browser.
